# Systivex — Agentic Software System Twin & Change Intelligence Platform

> Systivex is an **agentic software-system twin and engineering safety platform** connecting
> code, architecture, data, runtime behavior, simulation, policy-controlled execution, and verification.

Systivex builds a living **System Twin** of a software system — its code, architecture,
data flows, and runtime behavior — so that proposed changes can be **simulated, risk-assessed,
policy-gated, executed under control, and verified** before and after they touch real systems.

Systivex is **not**:

- an AI code reviewer,
- an SRE chatbot,
- a generic LLM wrapper,
- a chat assistant over logs.

Those are point tools. Systivex is a **control plane for safe engineering action**:
it grounds agent reasoning in an authoritative model of the system and only permits
consequential actions through explicit control-plane authorization.

## Current state (honest snapshot)

**Implemented** (verified 2026-09-30):

- Spring Boot 4.1.1 backend (`backend/`) on Java 21 / Maven.
- Application starts; `GET /actuator/health` returns `{"status":"UP"}`.
- PostgreSQL persistence: Spring Data JPA + Hibernate, Flyway-owned schema
  (`ddl-auto=validate` — Hibernate never modifies the schema).
- Initial twin persistence model: `SystemEntity` (7 closed types) and directed
  `SystemRelationship` (8 closed types), JSONB metadata, UUID keys,
  FK/unique/check constraints, `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- Minimal twin REST surface (`/api/v1/twin/entities`, `/api/v1/twin/relationships`)
  with DTOs, Bean Validation, and stable 400/404/409 error responses.
- 29 control-plane tests green: service unit tests plus Testcontainers-backed
  migration, repository, and API integration tests (now 31 with Phase 3A
  observability tests).
- Phase 2B target environment (`backend/target-services/`): four independently
  runnable Spring Boot services — gateway (8081) → order (8082) → inventory
  (8084) + payment (8083) — with real HTTP calls between processes and
  service-owned PostgreSQL databases (`order_db`, `payment_db`,
  `inventory_db`; gateway stateless; control-plane `systivex` separate).
  Persistent orders (PENDING → CONFIRMED/FAILED), recorded payment
  authorizations (AUTHORIZED/DECLINED), and real stock with locked
  reservations (seeded `SKU-1001 × 10` for local demos). Checkout across the
  three databases is deliberately not atomic — documented, not hidden.
  Controlled 400/422/502/503 error handling with nothing internal on the
  wire, and service tests green (Testcontainers-backed).
- Phase 3A observability (verified 2026-09-30): Boot-managed OpenTelemetry +
  Prometheus instrumentation in all five deployables; a local collector
  (`observability/`, Compose — telemetry infrastructure only, services still
  run locally) receives OTLP traces and re-exposes scraped metrics. One
  checkout produces one distributed trace across gateway → order →
  inventory + payment (verified in the collector log), with three business
  spans (`checkout`, `inventory.reservation`, `payment.authorization`),
  tag-free business counters, and trace-correlated console logs. Success,
  rejection, decline, and downstream-outage paths all emit telemetry. The
   control plane emits but consumes nothing yet — no twin ingestion, no
   dashboards, no anomaly detection, no agent use.
- Phase 3B-1 metrics visualization (verified 2026-10-06): Prometheus
  (`observability/`, Compose) scrapes the collector's `:8889` exposition —
  the single metrics path, no direct app scrapes — and Grafana (provisioned
  datasource + one `Systivex Metrics` dashboard, no manual setup) shows
  request rate, errors by outcome, average latency, JVM heap/CPU, service
  reporting, and checkout/inventory/payment business counters. Checkout and
  failure scenarios move the dashboard metrics live.
- Phase 3B-2 log exploration (implemented 2026-10-07, live verification
  pending service restarts): the same console records now also ship over
  OTLP through the existing collector into Loki (`observability/`,
  Compose — single binary, local filesystem, no auth), searchable in
   Grafana Explore via a provisioned Loki datasource (no new dashboard).
   Per-service Logback bridge (`logback-spring.xml` +
   `OtelLogAppenderInstaller`; Boot alone ships nothing — see
   `DECISIONS.md` D21). Only `service.name` is a Loki index label;
   trace/span IDs stay searchable structured metadata, never stream
   labels. Outcome + IDs only, same privacy guarantees as Phase 3A.
- Phase 4 twin observation (implemented 2026-10-09, local live boot
  pending): a read-only repository connector (`backend/.../observation/`)
  scans `backend/target-services/` configs, controller routes, and Flyway
  migrations into the twin — 4 services, 3 databases, 4 tables, 4 APIs
  (15 entities, 18 CALLS/DEPENDS_ON/CONTAINS/WRITES/EXPOSES edges) via an
  explicit `POST /api/v1/twin/sync` trigger. Idempotent, transactional,
  connector-owned rows only (manual rows preserved, conflicts fail 409).
  Localhost-only: `server.address=127.0.0.1` bind plus a loopback-peer
  guard (403 off loopback, no header trust). 51 tests green (31 existing
  + 20 new). The control plane still consumes no telemetry and no agent
  exists — see `DECISIONS.md` D22.

**Not yet implemented** (planned architecture only):

- Twin telemetry ingestion (metrics/traces/logs into the twin),
  Git integration
- Agent orchestration, tooling, evidence model
- Policy / risk / approval engine and controlled execution, simulation, verification
- Cross-database checkout atomicity/reconciliation, cache (Redis), Spring AI / Ollama, frontend
- Trace exploration UI (Tempo), unified trace/log UI, anomaly detection,
  any agent or automated use of telemetry (Loki log exploration is done;
  Tempo is a later slice)

No `frontend/`, no service containers — intentionally absent
(see `DECISIONS.md`: no premature infrastructure). The only Compose file is
`observability/docker-compose.yml`, scoped to the telemetry collector.
Database configuration exists
but is local-only: `application.properties` is git-ignored, only the safe
`application.example.properties` template is tracked.

## Quick start (current phase)

Prerequisite: **JDK 21** (`JAVA_HOME` must point to a JDK 21 installation).

```powershell
cd backend
$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10"
$env:Path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10\bin;" + $env:Path
./mvnw test                      # needs Docker (Testcontainers PostgreSQL)
$env:SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD="<local systivex_app password>"
./mvnw spring-boot:run           # needs local PostgreSQL, see DEVELOPMENT.md
# then: GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/health -> {"status":"UP"}
```

(Outside VS Code the `PATH` prepend matters too; inside a new VS Code
integrated terminal both variables are set automatically.)

Full instructions: [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Documentation map

| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Target architecture, control/target separation, trust boundaries, current status |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md` | Local build/test/run, prerequisites |

## Project rules (binding)

- Java 21, Spring Boot 4.1.1, Maven.
- Modular monolith for the Systivex **control plane**; microservices are reserved
  for the future **target software environment**, not for Systivex itself at this stage.
- PostgreSQL as primary persistence (Flyway-owned schema, Hibernate validates only);
  Redis only when justified; Spring AI + Ollama later.
- REST + SSE initially.
- Do not introduce Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, WebSockets, vector databases, MCP,
  multi-agent architecture, or cloud infrastructure at this stage.
