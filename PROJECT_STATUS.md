# Systivex Project Status

Last verified: **2026-10-09** (Asia/Kolkata). This document must be updated
whenever the implemented state changes. Planned items are not claimed as done.

## Current phase

**Phase 4 — Twin observation: read-only repository connector (implemented;
live verification complete 2026-10-09, ready for review).** Phases 0–3B-2 below
are kept as history.

## What is complete (Phase 4, 2026-10-09 — implementation + automated tests + live verification complete)

- [x] `observation` package in the control plane (new, only addition):
      `TargetRepositoryScanner` (read-only scan of `backend/target-services/`),
      `TwinSyncService` (transactional, idempotent sync), `SyncController`
      (`POST /api/v1/twin/sync`), `LoopbackGuard` (403 off loopback),
      `SyncResult`/`DiscoveryResult`/`DiscoveredEntity`/`DiscoveredRelationship`,
      `OwnershipConflictException` (409) / `SyncForbiddenException` (403),
      best-effort `GitRevision` (short HEAD or omitted). No new dependencies.
- [x] Deterministic mapping from verified repository facts (service
      directories, tracked `application.example.properties`, controller
      route annotations, Flyway `CREATE TABLE` statements) onto the
      EXISTING closed enums — no enum expansion: 4 `SERVICE`
      (gateway/order/payment/inventory :8081–:8084), 3 `DATABASE`
      (order_db/order_app, payment_db/payment_app,
      inventory_db/inventory_app), 4 `TABLE` (orders, payments,
      inventory_items, inventory_reservations), 4 `API` (POST
      /api/v1/checkout, POST /api/v1/orders, POST
      /internal/v1/inventory/reserve, POST /internal/v1/payments/authorize).
      18 edges: gateway `CALLS` order, order `CALLS` inventory + payment
      (from downstream URL configs), 3 `DEPENDS_ON`, 4 `CONTAINS`, 4
      `WRITES`, 4 `EXPOSES`. Stable `target-*` external refs; ports, paths,
      ownership, downstream evidence, and provenance
      (`managedBy: repository-connector`, `phase4-v1`) in metadata.
- [x] Sync semantics: discovery validates fully before any write; one
      transaction per run; connector-owned rows created/refreshed, manual
      rows never touched, identity collisions abort 409 with full rollback,
      bad roots fail 400 with no writes. Re-runs are idempotent
      (created:0/unchanged:15+18).
- [x] Localhost-only boundary (see `DECISIONS.md` D22): `server.address=
      127.0.0.1` in the tracked example config plus a transport-peer guard
      (`getRemoteAddr()` only, headers ignored, missing peer denied).
      Scanner reads example configs only — never live properties, never
      the environment, never writes or executes under the root.
- [x] Tests: 51 green, 0 failures (31 pre-existing + 20 new:
      `TargetRepositoryScannerTest` 7 incl. a read-only scan of the REAL
      target-services tree pinning 15 entities / 18 edges,
      `TwinSyncServiceTest` 5, `SyncApiTest` 5, `LoopbackGuardTest` 3);
      `package -DskipTests` builds. `backend/target-services/` and
      `observability/` untouched (verified via `git status`).
- [x] LIVE VERIFICATION 2026-10-09 (complete, observed directly in PowerShell
      against local PostgreSQL 18): control-plane health `UP`; PostgreSQL
      connection successful via a temporary `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` override
      to `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/systivex` (local
      `application.properties` not edited; no secret recorded here). First
      `POST /api/v1/twin/sync` with `'{}'` reported entitiesCreated 15,
      entitiesUpdated 0, entitiesUnchanged 0, relationshipsCreated 18,
      relationshipsUnchanged 0, repositoryRoot
      `C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\systivex\backend\target-services`, revision
      `4dc09df`. Second sync reported entitiesCreated 0, entitiesUpdated 0,
      entitiesUnchanged 15, relationshipsCreated 0,
      relationshipsUnchanged 18. `GET /api/v1/twin/entities` returned 15
      entities; `GET /api/v1/twin/relationships` returned 18 relationships;
      graph contains gateway-service, inventory-service, order-service, and
      payment-service. Prior automated evidence retained (no tests rerun in
      this review): `SyncApiTest` runs a REAL HTTP server (RANDOM_PORT) and
      syncs the REAL `backend/target-services` tree over loopback —
      200 + exact counts, 400 on a bad root with row counts unchanged,
      403 off loopback through the full handler chain; `TwinSyncServiceTest`
      syncs the real tree against throwaway PostgreSQL 18 (15/18 exact,
      idempotent re-run, manual-row preservation, conflict rollback to 1
      row / 0 edges). Nothing staged, committed, or pushed. Verdict: READY
      FOR REVIEW — implementation + automated tests + local live
      verification complete.
- [ ] STILL DEFERRED: Tempo, twin telemetry ingestion, unified trace/log UI,
      agents, intelligence/policy/execution/verification, Redis, brokers,
      K8s, vectors, MCP, frontend, Git remotes, watchers, schedulers,
      broad authentication (Milestone 2C item 2 still open).

## What is complete (Phase 3B-2, 2026-10-07 — implementation; live pending)

- [x] Loki (`grafana/loki:3.5.0`) in the existing
      `observability/docker-compose.yml`: single binary, filesystem storage
      in the `loki-data` volume, no auth (local development only — see
      `observability/loki-config.yml`). HTTP API on :3100. No clustering,
      no object storage.
- [x] Collector `logs` pipeline appended to the existing
      `observability/otel-collector.yml` (`otlp` receiver → `batch` →
      `otlphttp/loki` at `http://loki:3100/otlp`; the exporter appends
      `/v1/logs` itself — configuring the full path makes Loki answer 404,
      found the hard way and fixed). Traces/metrics pipelines untouched.
      The contrib `loki` exporter was evaluated first and rejected (gone
      from collector 0.140.x after upstream deprecation).
- [x] The missing Logback bridge (root cause of silent zero-export: Boot
      wires SDK + OTLP exporter but installs no appender, so properties
      alone ship nothing): `opentelemetry-logback-appender-1.0` per
      deployable (version from imported
      `opentelemetry-instrumentation-bom-alpha` `2.28.1-alpha`, which
      compiles against `opentelemetry-api 1.62.0` = Boot 4.1.1's managed
      SDK — no skew), identical `logback-spring.xml` (Boot base + OTEL
      appender, console untouched, MDC `traceId,spanId` captured), and a
      small `OtelLogAppenderInstaller` bean calling
      `OpenTelemetryAppender.install(openTelemetry)` on ready. Console
      format, log statements, sanitizer, and business logic unchanged.
- [x] Grafana Loki datasource provisioned from
      `observability/grafana/provisioning/datasources/loki.yml` (Prometheus
      stays default; health OK for both). Explore is the log UI — no new
      dashboard by decision.
- [x] Low-cardinality label policy enforced in Loki (`limits_config`
      `otlp_config`, explicit attribute lists): index carries
      `service_name` only — proven via the `/labels` index endpoint (one
      series per service) — while trace/span IDs, `service.instance.id`,
      SDK/process/host detail, and scope fields stay searchable structured
      metadata (`{service_name="order-service"} | traceId="<hex>"` finds
      the line; a wrong ID finds nothing). No customer/order/product/
      amount/request-body values in log form at all.
- [x] Tests: 91 green, 0 failures (control plane 31, gateway 8, order 24
      incl. new `OtlpLoggingExportTest` + `OtlpLogDeliveryTest`, payment
      12, inventory 16); all five `package -DskipTests` builds succeed.
      `OtlpLogDeliveryTest` is the regression test the missing bridge
      would have failed: a checkout record arrives at a stub OTLP
      receiver with MDC trace context, and checkout survives a dead
      receiver. Test-suite logs from all five deployables already flow
      through the fixed pipeline into Loki (observed live during the test
      runs — the bridge works in every module).
- [ ] LIVE VERIFICATION 2026-10-07 (blocked: services still run the
      pre-bridge build). Actually observed: health UP on :8081/:8082/
      :8083/:8084 plus control plane on :8090 (:8080 answers 401 from the
      other project's PolicyImpactEngineApplication — left alone by
      decision); Prometheus :9090 healthy with `otel-collector:8889` up;
      Loki :3100 ready; collector healthy; Grafana Loki + Prometheus
      datasources both report OK, and a `{service_name="..."}`
      query through the Grafana datasource proxy returns log lines
      (Explore path proven). Business behavior intact on the running
      builds: gateway checkout 201 CONFIRMED; inventory rejection 422
      `INVENTORY_REJECTED`; payment decline 422 `PAYMENT_DECLINED`;
      counters moved (`checkout_failure` 0→2, rejected/declined 0→1);
      fresh 4-service distributed trace in the collector log
      (gateway→order→inventory+payment with `checkout`,
      `inventory.reservation`, `payment.authorization` spans; rejection
      path correctly stops before payment). Metrics and tracing show no
      regression. BUT the four target processes (PIDs 14948/20804/21068/
      596, started 19:13) still run the pre-bridge build — the restart
      did not take effect — so NO live service log reaches Loki: the
      three verification order IDs (success/rejection/decline) return
      zero Loki lines. Loki currently holds only test-suite logs (which
      do prove the bridge works in all five deployables) plus probes.
      Label policy holds live: `/labels` index endpoint carries
      `service_name` only (one series per service via `/series`);
      `traceId` has no index values yet stays searchable as structured
      metadata (positive filter finds the probe line, wrong ID finds
      nothing). Sensitive-data audit over 664 Loki lines: zero hits for
      passwords/API keys/authorization headers/bearer/access tokens/
      synthetic span-test tokens/JDBC secrets; the single `CUST-1001`
      hit is a test-fixture row echoed in a Hibernate
      constraint-violation ERROR from `OrderRepositoryTest` — test data,
      not a live leak, but noted: framework error logs can echo row
      detail (console-identical content, now also searchable in Loki).
      Live order IDs have zero Loki hits of any kind. Kill-based outage
      test deliberately skipped: stopping inventory would strand it down
      with no restart permitted, for zero new signal (stale builds ship
      nothing to Loki either way). Verdict: NOT READY TO REVIEW —
      implementation + pipeline + policy proven, live service-log
      verification impossible until the services actually restart with
       the bridge build.
- [ ] LIVE VERIFICATION 2026-10-09 (partial; success path still blocked).
      Actually observed: order/inventory/payment PIDs 10744/12700/27064
      (started 11:19/11:36) run jars built 11:18–11:19 that all contain
      the bridge (`OtelLogAppenderInstaller`, `logback-spring.xml`,
      `opentelemetry-logback-appender-1.0-2.28.1-alpha` verified inside
      every jar) and all three already ship live logs to Loki (startup
      lines + `Trace ID` spans observed), so they were NOT killed:
      `ORDER/PAYMENT/INVENTORY_DB_PASSWORD` are absent from every
      reachable shell (process/user/machine) and their parent shells are
      gone, so killing them would strand them down with no restart.
      Gateway was down (no :8081 listener) and is stateless, so only it
      was (re)started — twice under `java.exe` (PIDs 30884/30508, both
      reached UP and shipped startup lines to Loki, then vanished;
      suspected host reaping of console java, as noted 2026-10-06) and
      finally under `javaw.exe` (PID 15132, UP, startup line in Loki).
      Health UP on :8081/:8082/:8083/:8084; Loki :3100 ready; collector
      healthy; Prometheus healthy; Grafana Loki + Prometheus datasources
      present. Two live checkouts through the gateway both returned 422
      `FAILED`/`INVENTORY_REJECTED` (order IDs
      `ad49f3c4-…` qty 1 and `8691d773-…` qty 99): `inventory_items`
      holds 0 units for `SKU-1001` (seed was 10, successes since have
      consumed it; qty-1 `insufficient-stock` proves 0), so no CONFIRMED
      checkout and no payment-decline probe is currently possible.
      Failure-path Loki verification SUCCEEDS on live services: both
      order IDs return order-service `Checkout <id> FAILED inventory`
      plus inventory-service `Reservation <id> REJECTED
      insufficient-stock` lines sharing one `traceId` per checkout
      (`d04e8d42…`, `d312a1e6…`) with distinct `spanId`s; payment
      correctly absent; gateway has no business log by design (forwards
      only). Same lines retrievable through the Grafana Loki datasource
      proxy (Explore path proven). Collector log holds 7 spans for trace
      `d312a1e6…` (3 order + 2 inventory + 2 gateway); the order→
      inventory client span's parent equals the Loki `spanId`
      `17e014b0…`, and error attributes are sanitized
      (`SanitizedObservationError`, `[HTTP 422] (response body withheld
      from telemetry)`). Label policy holds live (`/labels` =
      `service_name` only); wrong-traceId filter returns zero lines.
      Privacy audit over Loki (counts only, nothing printed): zero hits
      for passwords/API keys/authorization/bearer/JDBC/synthetic
      `CUSTOMER/PRODUCT/AMOUNT-TEST` tokens and zero hits for live
      `CUST-1001`/`SKU-1001`/amounts in log lines. A temporary
      `pg_hba.conf` trust line for password recovery was considered to
      restock `SKU-1001` but REVERTED unused (byte-identical SHA256
      restore verified): `pg_ctl reload` is `Operation not permitted`
      unelevated and restarting PostgreSQL is forbidden, so the change
      could never take effect. No app code, dependency, config, or DB
      content was modified; nothing staged/committed/pushed; no secret
      was printed. Verdict: NOT READY TO REVIEW — failure-path live-log
      verification now proven, but success-path (CONFIRMED checkout,
      4-service log correlation incl. payment) still requires
      service passwords, all currently unavailable).
- [x] LIVE VERIFICATION 2026-10-09 (success path closed; user restocked
      `SKU-1001` to 10 via pgAdmin, no service restarted, nothing
      modified). Actually observed, all against live PIDs
      10744/12700/27064 + gateway javaw 15132 (health UP :8081–:8084
      throughout): qty-1 checkout → HTTP 201 `CONFIRMED` (order
      `364f57f0-…`, reservation `c1be65d6-…`, authorization
      `dec876ee-…`); amount-6000.00 qty-1 checkout → HTTP 422
      `FAILED`/`PAYMENT_DECLINED` (order `1fc3ed65-…`). Loki holds both:
      success trace `478fc42d…` = order `Checkout … CONFIRMED` +
      inventory `Reservation c1be65d6-… RESERVED` + payment
      `Authorization dec876ee-… AUTHORIZED` (IDs cross-match the HTTP
      response); decline trace `15890c89…` = order `FAILED payment` +
      inventory `RESERVED` (stock held, non-atomic by design D17) +
      payment `DECLINED`. Same lines via Grafana proxy. Collector
      exported both traces (20 span lines). Metrics: `checkout_success`
      1, `checkout_failure` 3, payment success/declined 1/1, inventory
      rejected 2. Privacy re-audit: zero hits for passwords/API
      keys/bearer/JDBC/synthetic tokens/customer/product/amount values;
      the two `(?i)authorization` hits are the benign domain log word
      (`Authorization <uuid> AUTHORIZED|DECLINED`, IDs only). Verdict:
      READY TO REVIEW.
- [ ] STILL DEFERRED: Tempo, dedicated trace UI, unified trace/log UI,
      System Twin telemetry ingestion, any agent use of telemetry.

## What is complete (Phase 3B-1, 2026-10-06)

- [x] Prometheus (`prom/prometheus:v3.5.0`) in the existing
      `observability/docker-compose.yml`: scrapes only the OTel Collector's
      `:8889` exposition (single metrics path — never the Java services
      directly, no duplicate collection). Scrape config in the tracked
      `observability/prometheus.yml`, including a `server_port` →
      `service` relabeling (the collector stamps `service_name="systivex"`
      on everything, so per-service identity comes from the receiver-kept
      port label).
- [x] Grafana (`grafana/grafana:12.1.0`) in the same Compose file, UI on
      :3000: Prometheus datasource + one `Systivex Metrics` dashboard fully
      provisioned from `observability/grafana/` (fresh `up -d` reproduces
      both, no browser clicks, no secrets, no database files in Git).
- [x] Dashboard (9 panels, low-cardinality labels only): services reporting,
      HTTP request rate, requests by outcome, average latency (sum/count —
      OTel histograms arrive without buckets on this path, so no p95),
      JVM heap, process CPU, checkout success/failure, inventory
      reservation success/rejected, payment authorization
      success/declined.
- [x] Live verified 2026-10-06: collector + Prometheus + Grafana healthy;
      Prometheus target `otel-collector:8889` up; gateway/order/payment/
      inventory series present (control plane verified directly on a
      temporary :8090 — :8080 is held by another project's
      PolicyImpactEngineApplication on this machine); Grafana datasource
      health OK and dashboard loads with data; success checkout moved
      `checkout_success_total` 0→1, rejection moved `checkout_failure`
      0→1, payment decline moved `payment_authorization_declined_total`
      0→1 and `checkout_failure` 1→2. No Java changes; 88 tests still green.
- [ ] STILL DEFERRED: Loki, Tempo, unified logs/traces UI, System Twin
      telemetry ingestion, any agent use of telemetry.

## What is complete (Phase 3A, 2026-09-30)

- [x] Boot-managed instrumentation in all five deployables (control plane +
      gateway/order/payment/inventory): `spring-boot-starter-opentelemetry`
      + `micrometer-registry-prometheus`, no hand-pinned versions, no second
      instrumentation library.
- [x] Distributed tracing verified end to end: one `POST /api/v1/checkout`
      produces a single trace ID across gateway → order → inventory +
      payment in the collector log (server + client HTTP spans per hop).
      Trace context crosses every RestClient hop via observation-registry
      builders; no hand-made trace IDs anywhere.
- [x] Three custom business spans only (`checkout`, `inventory.reservation`,
      `payment.authorization`); no sensitive attributes on any span.
- [x] Metrics: `/actuator/prometheus` on all five (HTTP count/duration/
      status, JVM/runtime, availability) plus six tag-free business counters
      (`checkout.success/failure`, `inventory.reservation.success/rejected`,
      `payment.authorization.success/declined`) — no customer/order/product/
      trace labels. Metrics stay pull-based; OTLP metric/log export off.
- [x] Correlated console logging (`[service,traceId,spanId]`): outcome + IDs
      only, no payloads or secrets; log lines link back to collector traces.
- [x] Local collection path (`observability/docker-compose.yml`,
      `observability/otel-collector.yml`, contrib 0.140.0): OTLP traces →
      debug log, Prometheus scrape of all services → :8889. Java services
      are not containerized; no dashboards, log store, or trace store.
- [x] Failure telemetry verified live: inventory rejection (422), payment
      decline (422), and inventory outage (order 503 → gateway 502) all emit
      spans, move the failure counters, and keep health green elsewhere.
- [x] Sensitive-data audit: no passwords/credentials/tokens/secrets in logs,
      labels, or span attributes. Closure fix: recorded observation errors
      are sanitized per deployable (`ObservationErrorSanitizer`, type name +
      HTTP status only — no bodies, no business messages, no cause chain),
      covered by `TelemetryPrivacyTest`, verified failing without the fix
      and passing with it.
- [x] 85 tests green: control plane 31 (29 unchanged + 2 observability),
      gateway 8 (6 + 2), order 18 (15 + 2 observability + 1 privacy),
      payment 12 (11 + 1),
      inventory 16 (15 + 1). New tests assert metric families and W3C
      traceparent propagation without a collector; no exporter-format
      assertions.
- [x] Control-plane regression: all 29 Phase 1 tests green, behavior
      unchanged; control-plane observability is covered by 2 integration
      tests (real spans, health UP).
- [ ] PENDING LIVE VERIFICATION (phase paused 2026-09-30, implementation
      and automated tests complete): control-plane live startup, live
      health endpoint, and live `/actuator/prometheus` were not observed —
      the required credential is unavailable in the verification session.
      Target-service live verification (health, metrics, checkout,
      rejection, decline, outage, distributed trace) is complete from the
      prior pass; the final post-redaction five-service live trace run is
      still to be collected. Nothing is claimed verified beyond what the
      verification tables record. Verdict: NOT READY TO COMMIT.
- [ ] RE-CHECK 2026-10-01 (still blocked, nothing newly marked verified):
      `SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD`, `ORDER_DB_PASSWORD`, `PAYMENT_DB_PASSWORD`,
      and `INVENTORY_DB_PASSWORD` are all absent from the verification
      process environment (presence-checked by name only, no values shown).
      Actually observed: control-plane jar exits during Flyway startup
      (PostgreSQL 28P01 authentication failure for the control-plane user,
      `/actuator/health` unreachable on :8080); order-service jar exits
      during Flyway init (server requested SCRAM authentication with no
      password provided, :8082 unreachable). Gateway-service alone starts
      (`GET :8081/actuator/health` UP, `GET :8081/actuator/prometheus` 200)
      and the local OTel Collector starts (`:13133` health 200, OTLP
      :4317/:4318 listening, scrape warnings only for the stopped
      services) — but no distributed checkout, failure, outage, privacy,
      metrics, or logging live verification was possible without the four
      database credentials. Automated suites re-run green on 2026-10-01:
      control plane 31, gateway 8, order 18, payment 12, inventory 16
      (total 85); all five `package -DskipTests` builds succeed.
      IMPLEMENTED = Phase 3A code/tests/collector config as listed above.
      VERIFIED = automated tests + builds + gateway-solo health/metrics +
      collector health only. DEFERRED = full five-service live trace run
      and all live failure/privacy/metrics/logging checks, pending the
       four missing credentials. Verdict remains: NOT READY TO COMMIT.
- [ ] RE-CHECK 2026-10-01 (live run, still blocked — control plane newly
      verified live): all four credential variables are now PRESENT in the
      verification process environment (presence-checked by name only, no
      values shown, nothing written to disk). Local-only fix (git-ignored,
      not committed): `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
      carried a duplicated key prefix on the password line, so the packaged
      jar ignored the environment; fixed to
      `spring.datasource.password=${SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD:}` and rebuilt the
      control-plane jar. Actually observed live: control-plane starts
      (Flyway validates 1 migration, schema v1 up to date; Hibernate
      validates, EntityManagerFactory initialized; Tomcat :8080;
      `GET /actuator/health` UP; `GET /actuator/prometheus` 200 with HTTP +
      JVM families). Gateway-service starts (`GET :8081/actuator/health` UP,
      `/actuator/prometheus` 200) and the local OTel Collector starts
      (`:13133` healthy, `:8889/metrics` 200). Order/payment/inventory jars
      still exit during Flyway startup: PostgreSQL 28P01 password
      authentication failure for `order_app`/`payment_app`/`inventory_app`
      against `order_db`/`payment_db`/`inventory_db` (all three databases
      exist; direct `psql` auth with the current environment values fails
      while `systivex_app` succeeds) — so :8082/:8083/:8084 stay
      unreachable. Blocked live: five-service health set, checkout through
      gateway, distributed trace, business spans, failure paths
      (rejection/decline/outage), live privacy check
      (CUSTOMER-TEST/PRODUCT-TEST/AMOUNT-TEST), live metrics/logging
      correlation. Automated suites re-run green on 2026-10-01 (actual
      count): control plane 31, gateway 8, order 18 (incl.
      TelemetryPrivacyTest), payment 12, inventory 16 (total 85, 0
      failures); all five `package -DskipTests` builds succeed. All
      services and the collector stopped after the run; nothing staged,
      committed, or pushed. IMPLEMENTED = Phase 3A code/tests/collector
      config as listed above. VERIFIED = automated tests (85) + builds +
      control-plane live startup/health/metrics + gateway-solo
      health/metrics + collector health/metrics only. DEFERRED = full
      five-service live trace run and all live
      checkout/failure/outage/privacy/metrics/logging checks, pending
      working `ORDER_DB_PASSWORD`, `PAYMENT_DB_PASSWORD`, and
       `INVENTORY_DB_PASSWORD` values. Verdict remains: NOT READY TO COMMIT.
- [ ] RE-CHECK 2026-10-01 (live run, five-service verification complete,
      new privacy blocker found): all four credential variables are PRESENT
      in the verification process environment (presence-checked by name only,
      no values shown, nothing written to disk). Actually observed live with
      all five jars running plus the local OTel Collector: inventory :8084
      (HikariPool connected, Flyway validated 2 migrations, schema up to
      date, Hibernate initialized, UP), payment :8083 (1 migration, UP),
      order :8082 (1 migration, UP), control-plane :8080 (UP), gateway :8081
      (UP), collector (`:13133` healthy, `:8889/metrics` re-exposing scrapes).
      `/actuator/prometheus` 200 on all five with HTTP families; business
      counters observed live (`checkout.success=1`,
      `inventory.reservation.success=1`, `payment.authorization.success=1`).
      Successful checkout CONFIRMED through the gateway with one trace ID
      across gateway/order/inventory/payment (server + client spans per hop
      plus `checkout`, `inventory.reservation`, `payment.authorization`);
      correlated `[service,traceId,spanId]` outcome lines in
      order/inventory/payment logs match the collector trace. Inventory
      rejection 422 `INVENTORY_REJECTED`, payment decline 422
      `PAYMENT_DECLINED`, and inventory outage (order 503
      `DOWNSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` → gateway 502) all verified live with failure
      counters moved (`checkout.failure=4`, rejected/declined = 1 each),
      partial error traces exported, and health green on the survivors.
      LIVE PRIVACY TEST FAILED: synthetic `CUSTOMER-TEST-*` /
      `PRODUCT-TEST-001` / distinctive-amount values are absent from service
      logs and from span `exception` tags (`SanitizedObservationError`), but
      ARE present in exported error span attributes — `exception.message`,
      `exception.stacktrace`, and span Status messages — on RestClient client
      spans (gateway/order) and business spans (`checkout`,
      `payment.authorization`, `inventory.reservation`). Mechanism (read-only
      bytecode check, no code changed): Boot registers tracing handlers in a
      group composite ahead of ungrouped `ObservationHandler` beans, so the
      tracing handler records the raw exception event before
      `ObservationErrorSanitizer` replaces the final recorded error;
      `TelemetryPrivacyTest` stays green (re-run 1/1) because it asserts only
      the final recorded error, never span events. Useful telemetry survives
      (HTTP status/outcome/uri, trace context, service identity, span
      names). Automated suites re-run green on 2026-10-01 (actual count,
      `mvn test` without `clean` because `clean` cannot delete the
      running-process jars): control plane 31, gateway 8, order 18 (incl.
      `TelemetryPrivacyTest`), payment 12, inventory 16 (total 85, 0
      failures); all five `package -DskipTests` builds succeed after
       shutdown. All services and the collector stopped after the run; nothing
       staged, committed, or pushed. IMPLEMENTED = Phase 3A code/tests/
       collector config as listed above. VERIFIED = automated tests (85) +
       builds + full five-service live run (health/metrics/checkout/trace/
       rejection/decline/outage/logging) as recorded here. BLOCKED = live
       telemetry privacy (raw business values in exported error span events
       despite the sanitizer). Verdict remains: NOT READY TO COMMIT.
- [x] RE-CHECK 2026-10-06 (telemetry privacy fix verified live, Phase 3A
      closure): the late sanitizer is replaced by a per-deployable
      `SanitizerObservationHandlerGroup` ordered before Boot's tracing
      handler group (mechanism proven against Boot 4.1.1 / Micrometer
      1.17.1 / micrometer-tracing 1.7.1 bytecode; see DECISIONS.md D19
      correction). Automated suites green, 0 failures: control plane 31,
      gateway 8, order 21 (incl. span-data `TelemetryPrivacyTest` +
      negative-direction `TelemetryPrivacyUnsanitizedTest`), payment 12,
      inventory 16 (total 88); all five `package -DskipTests` builds
      succeed. Live, all five jars + local OTel Collector: health UP on
      :8080/:8081/:8082/:8083/:8084; gateway checkout 201 CONFIRMED;
      inventory rejection 422 `INVENTORY_REJECTED`; payment decline 422
      `PAYMENT_DECLINED`; inventory outage → order 503 → gateway 502 with
      health green on survivors and inventory recovered after restart;
      one distributed trace across gateway/order/inventory/payment plus
      `checkout`, `inventory.reservation`, `payment.authorization` spans;
      collector-log trace IDs match service log `[traceId,spanId]` lines.
      LIVE PRIVACY TEST PASSES: synthetic `CUSTOMER-TEST-XXXX` /
      `PRODUCT-TEST-001` / `AMOUNT-TEST-999` appear in HTTP 422 response
      bodies (contract preserved) but have ZERO hits in the full collector
      span log; exported `exception` events carry only
      `SanitizedObservationError` with type name + HTTP status
      (`... [HTTP 422/503] (response body withheld from telemetry)` /
      `<Type> (detail withheld from telemetry)`). HTTP behavior,
      controller behavior, and logs unchanged; metrics correct
      (`checkout.success=2/failure=3`, decline/counter families present,
      :8889 serving). Environment note: this host reaps console
      `java.exe` processes, so live services ran under `javaw.exe` (same
      JVM, file logging) — verification-only detail, no code impact. All
      services and the collector stopped after the run; nothing staged,
      committed, or pushed. IMPLEMENTED = Phase 3A code/tests/collector
      config as listed above, with the group-ordered sanitizer in all five
      deployables. VERIFIED = automated tests (88) + builds + full
      five-service live run (health/metrics/success checkout/distributed
      trace/rejection/decline/outage/logging) + live span-data privacy
      (zero token hits, sanitized markers present). Verdict: READY TO
      COMMIT (Phase 3A only; Phase 3B not started).

## What is complete (Phase 2B, 2026-09-30)

## What is complete (Phase 2B, 2026-09-30)

- [x] Three service-owned PostgreSQL databases, created by the tracked
      `backend/target-services/create-target-databases.sql` (no passwords in
      the repo): `order_db`/`order_app`, `payment_db`/`payment_app`,
      `inventory_db`/`inventory_app`. Control-plane `systivex` untouched.
- [x] Per-service persistence stack (Boot-managed): Spring Data JPA,
      PostgreSQL driver, Flyway + PostgreSQL module; `ddl-auto=validate`
      everywhere; each service migrates only its own history.
- [x] `orders` table (PENDING → CONFIRMED/FAILED, UUID keys, CHECK
      constraints); checkout persists PENDING first, CONFIRMED only when both
      downstream calls succeed, FAILED otherwise — failed attempts recorded,
      never dropped or falsely confirmed.
- [x] `payments` table (AUTHORIZED/DECLINED, both outcomes persisted);
      deterministic 5000.00 decline rule kept, still no provider integration.
- [x] `inventory_items` + `inventory_reservations` (no FK between them, so
      unknown-product attempts are recordable); reserve locks the stock row
      (pessimistic write + `@Version`), decrements only on success, records
      REJECTED attempts; `V2` seeds dev stock `SKU-1001 × 10`.
- [x] Documented non-atomicity across the three databases (no distributed
      transactions, no cross-DB writes) — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `DECISIONS.md` D17.
- [x] 47 service tests green (Testcontainers PostgreSQL, no local DB touched):
      order 15, payment 11, inventory 15 (incl. concurrent-reserve locking),
      gateway 6. Full 4-process run with real databases demonstrated success
      + inventory rejection + payment decline paths.
- [x] Controlled failures preserved: no SQL/JDBC text, stack traces, or
      credentials on the wire; storage outage surfaces as 503 per service.

## What is complete (Phase 2A, 2026-09-29)

## What is complete (Phase 2A, 2026-09-29)

- [x] Four standalone target services under `backend/target-services/`:
      gateway (8081), order (8082), payment (8083), inventory (8084).
- [x] Each on Java 21 / Spring Boot 4.1.1 / Maven, own wrapper + app class +
      Actuator health; control plane untouched on 8080.
- [x] Real HTTP checkout flow: gateway → order → inventory + payment
      (RestClient, config-driven URLs), verified across live processes.
- [x] Explicit per-service DTO contracts; deterministic stateless
      approve/reject rules (documented as temporary until Phase 2B).
- [x] Controlled failures: 400 validation, 422 business rejection, 503 order
      level, 502 gateway level — no stack traces or internals on the wire.
- [x] 23 service tests green (real-HTTP boundaries, loopback stubs for
      downstream only); full 4-process run demonstrated success + inventory
      rejection + inventory outage.

## What is complete (Phase 1, 2026-09-29)

- [x] PostgreSQL 18 wired as primary persistence (`systivex` db, `systivex_app` user).
- [x] Spring Data JPA + Hibernate; `ddl-auto=validate` (no schema auto-generation).
- [x] Flyway owns the schema; `V1__create_system_twin.sql` migrates at startup.
- [x] Twin persistence model: `SystemEntity` (7 types, JSONB metadata, UUID keys)
      and directed `SystemRelationship` (8 types) with FK/unique/check constraints.
- [x] `TwinService` + two repositories; DTO-based REST CRUD under `/api/v1/twin`.
- [x] Stable error responses: 400 validation/malformed, 404 unknown id, 409 conflicts.
- [x] 29 tests green (unit + Testcontainers migration/repository/API integration).
- [x] Local run verified against PostgreSQL: Flyway V1 applied, health `UP`,
      entity/relationship REST cycle exercised.
- [x] Credentials stay out of Git: live `application.properties` ignored, password
      via `SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD`, only the safe example template tracked.

## What is complete (Phase 0, 2026-09-28)

- [x] Repository root created (`Systivex/`).
- [x] Backend generated via Spring Initializr into `backend/`.
- [x] Backend pinned to **Java 21** (`<java.version>21</java.version>`, `release 21` verified).
- [x] Backend pinned to **Spring Boot 4.1.1** (parent + banner verified).
- [x] Maven build via Wrapper (3.9.16, `wrapperVersion 3.3.4`) verified.
- [x] Dependencies limited to the generated set: `webmvc`, `validation`, `actuator` (+ test starters).
- [x] Application starts (Tomcat 11.0.24 on `:8080`, startup ~1.4 s).
- [x] Actuator health endpoint verified: `GET /actuator/health` → `{"status":"UP"}`.
- [x] Test suite verified: `./mvnw test` → 1 test (`contextLoads`), 0 failures.
- [x] Build verified: `./mvnw package` → `systivex-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` (~23.6 MB).
- [x] Root documentation created: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`,
      `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file), `DECISIONS.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`.
- [x] Root `.gitignore` created (Java/Maven, IDE, OS, secrets).
- [x] Workspace-local JDK 21 environment: `.vscode/settings.json` (local-only,
      git-ignored) pins the Java extension and new integrated terminals to
      `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10`; portable template tracked at
      `.vscode/settings.json.example`. Global `JAVA_HOME`/PATH untouched.

## What is intentionally NOT implemented

These are **deferred by decision**, not missing by accident. Do not report them as regressions.

- Richer twin ingestion (code-AST parsing beyond manifests/routes/
  migrations, runtime/telemetry connectors), Git integration.
  (The Phase 4 repository connector — configs/routes/migrations — is done.)
- Tempo trace exploration UI, unified trace/log UI, automated anomaly
  detection, any agent use of telemetry, observability-driven decisions.
  (Loki log exploration is Phase 3B-2, above.)
- Agent orchestration, tool mediation, simulation, evidence model.
- Policy / approval / controlled-execution / verification logic.
- Filtering, pagination, graph traversal, bulk import on the twin API.
- Authentication/authorization on the API.
- Redis configuration or usage.
- Spring AI / Ollama integration, model configuration.
- React (JavaScript, no TypeScript) frontend; no `frontend/` directory.
- Docker packaging of the Java services or any container orchestration
  (Compose exists only for the telemetry collector, `observability/`).
- Cross-service database access, shared schemas, distributed transactions
  (rejected by decision D17, not missing).
- Message brokers; Kubernetes; WebSockets;
  vector databases; MCP; multi-agent architecture; cloud infrastructure.
- Placeholder or speculative backend packages beyond `twin`.

## Problem discovered → resolved (workspace-local JDK 21)

- **Default JDK on PATH is 17, not 21.** `JAVA_HOME` pointed at an OpenJDK 17
  installation and `mvn -version` reported Java 17. The project requires Java 21.
- **Resolution (2026-09-28, no global change):** `.vscode/settings.json` sets
  `java.jdt.ls.java.home` + `java.configuration.runtimes` (JavaSE-21 default) and
  `terminal.integrated.env.windows` (`JAVA_HOME` + JDK 21 `bin` prepended to the
  inherited PATH). Verified in a fresh equivalent shell: `java 21.0.10`,
  `JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10`, Maven `Java version: 21.0.10`,
  `.\mvnw.cmd clean test` → 1 test, 0 failures, BUILD SUCCESS. No code, dependency,
  or Maven-config change was needed; Java 17 projects are unaffected.
- **Git decision:** `settings.json` is intentionally **untracked** (absolute local
  JDK path would break portability); only `.vscode/settings.json.example` is
  tracked. Root `.gitignore` uses `.vscode/*` + `!.vscode/settings.json.example`.

## Immediate next milestone (proposed, not started)

**Milestone 2C remainder + twin telemetry ingestion:**

1. ~~Repository connector reading the target services into twin rows~~ DONE
   (Phase 4, above).
2. Authentication on any API before the surface leaves the local machine
   (still open — the Phase 4 loopback bind + guard is a development
   boundary, not auth).
3. Twin telemetry ingestion: consume the observed metrics/traces/logs
   contract (Phase 3A/3B-1/3B-2) into twin rows — still without agents or
   execution.

Out of scope: agents, simulation, approvals UI, brokers, K8s,
vector search, frontend beyond API consumption readiness. Cross-database
atomicity for checkout stays out unless a future decision with a concrete
reconciliation design asks for it.
