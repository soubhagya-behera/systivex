# Systivex Threat Model

Scope: **foundation + persistence + target-runtime + telemetry principles** (2026-09-30). Enforcement
mechanisms (policy engine, approvals, audit store) are **planned, not implemented** —
these principles bind all future design so the mechanisms can be built correctly.

## 1. System under analysis (today)

A single Spring Boot control plane on `:8080` exposing Actuator `health` plus a
local twin CRUD API (`/api/v1/twin`), backed by its own PostgreSQL database
(`systivex`) via Flyway migrations and validated JPA mappings. Alongside it,
four Phase 2B target services on `:8081–:8084` (gateway → order → inventory/payment)
with open local HTTP APIs, now backed by three service-owned databases
(`order_db`, `payment_db`, `inventory_db`, each with its own application user
that owns nothing else). No user data of value yet, no agents, no execution
capability, and the control plane does not call the target services.
Credential handling is load-bearing in both halves: every datasource password
(control-plane `SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD` plus `ORDER/PAYMENT/INVENTORY_DB_PASSWORD`)
reaches its app only through the environment; all live `application.properties`
files are git-ignored and only secret-free example templates are tracked. The
gateway holds no database credentials at all.

## 2. Trust principles (binding)

### T1. The LLM is untrusted

- LLM output is **data**, never instruction. It is never executed, never used as
  authorization, and never treated as fact about the target system.
- Tool and connector outputs are likewise data by default, not authority:
  they inform proposals but never substitute for control-plane authorization.
- Every LLM-derived claim used in a decision must be corroborated against the
  System Twin or live backend state before it influences action.

### T2. User input is untrusted

- All input arriving at the control plane (REST bodies, SSE parameters, future
  UI/API calls) is validated, size-bounded, and encoded on output.
- Validation (`spring-boot-starter-validation` is present) must be applied at
  every trust boundary; validation failures fail closed with no side effects.

### T3. Backend systems are authoritative

- Ground truth is the System Twin (planned) backed by versioned backend state
  (code, config, runtime signals) — not model output, not client assertions.
- Reads that inform consequential decisions must come through authenticated,
  integrity-checked connectors; stale or unverifiable state blocks action, not permits it.
- Between target services this already applies in miniature: order-service
  never reads inventory or payment state from their databases (it cannot — no
  grants, no shared schema), only from their HTTP responses, which it treats
  as untrusted input validated at the boundary. Database ownership is a
  security boundary, not just an organizational one.

### T4. The agent cannot authorize itself

- Proposal and authorization are separate roles. The agent (planned) may propose
  changes and request actions; only the control plane's policy/execution path
  (planned) may authorize them.
- No tool, prompt, credential, or code path may allow an agent to mint, escalate,
  or replay its own authorization.

### T5. Consequential actions require control-plane authorization

- Any action with side effects outside the control plane (target-environment
  change, credential use, data mutation, outbound call) must cross the
  policy → execution boundary with an explicit grant.
- Default-deny: absence of a policy decision is denial. Failures fail closed.

### T6. High-risk actions require approval

- Actions classified high-risk (production writes, destructive operations,
  security-sensitive changes — classification to be defined with the policy engine)
  additionally require explicit human or delegated-policy approval before execution.
- Approval is bound to the exact assessed proposal (parameters, target, twin
  revision); any material change re-enters assessment.

### T7. Consequential actions must be auditable

- Every authorization, approval, execution, and verification outcome produces an
  append-only record: who/what was proposed, which policy version decided,
  who approved (if required), what executed, and what verification observed.
- Audit records must be sufficient to reconstruct and explain any change after the fact.

## 3a. Telemetry as a data surface (Phase 3A, verified 2026-09-30)

Telemetry is evidence about behavior, not a trusted channel — and it is
itself a place data can leak. The following holds for the current pipeline
(services → local collector debug log / local scrape endpoints):

- **Span attributes no longer carry bodies or business messages.**
  Automatic RestClient-error spans used to record the downstream 4xx response
  body in `exception.message`, and custom business observations recorded
  service-layer messages — both reachable by customer/product/amount data.
  A per-deployable `ObservationErrorSanitizer` now participates in Boot's
  observation-handler grouping through its own group ordered BEFORE the
  tracing handler group (verified against Boot 4.1.1 registration order),
  so the error the tracing handler records is already the payload-free
  replacement keeping only the original exception type name and the HTTP
  status; no credentials, passwords, tokens, or secrets were observed in
  span attributes, and a 2026-10-06 live collector-log check found zero
  synthetic-token hits across success/rejection/decline/outage traces.
  Guarantee (narrow, as implemented): observation-error paths cannot carry
  response bodies, business messages, or cause chains into spans. NOT
  claimed: that no future span attribute, log line, or metric label could
  ever carry sensitive data — telemetry remains a leakage surface and any
  new attribute/label/message must be reviewed here first. Covered by
  `TelemetryPrivacyTest` (recorded span data) plus the negative-direction
  `TelemetryPrivacyUnsanitizedTest`. Until a trace backend beyond the local
  collector exists, trace output stays on the local machine regardless.
- **Logs carry only outcome + internal IDs.** The three business log lines
  emit reservation/authorization/order IDs with a status word — no customer,
  product, amount, header, or secret values. Correlation uses the trace/span
  IDs in the log pattern, not payload data.
- **Phase 3B-2 log pipeline (2026-10-07): records now leave the JVM.**
  The OTel Logback bridge ships the same console records over OTLP to the
  collector and into Loki; nothing new is logged. What travels per record:
  the message text (outcome + IDs, unchanged), MDC `traceId`/`spanId`
  strings, and the native OTel trace/span IDs — all as structured metadata
  or message content, never as Loki index labels (only `service.name` is a
  label; see `DECISIONS.md` D21). The Phase 3A sanitizer is untouched and
  still governs span errors; log content was already payload-free, so no
  new redaction was needed. Verified live: no passwords, credentials,
  authorization headers, tokens, request bodies, or business payloads in
  Loki; synthetic privacy tokens from the span tests have no log path to
  leak through. Logs remain evidence about runtime behavior, not
  authoritative truth — a log line proves a code path ran, not that the
  world matches it. Cardinality is a consumption risk, not just a cost
  one: unbounded labels would also be a cheap denial-of-service against
  the local Loki, which is why the label policy is binding, not advisory.
- **Metrics are tag-free by rule.** The six business counters have no labels
  at all; in particular customer, order, product, and trace IDs must never
  become metric labels (cardinality abuse would also be a cheap
  denial-of-service against the local collector). Standard HTTP/JVM metrics
  keep only their low-cardinality framework labels.
- **Access boundary is the loopback interface.** Scrape endpoints
  (`/actuator/prometheus`), OTLP receivers (:4317/:4318), the
  collector's :8889 exposition, Loki's :3100 API, and Grafana's :3000 UI
  have no authentication — acceptable only because everything binds
  locally and nothing is reachable beyond the machine. Exposing any of
  these beyond localhost requires authentication and a recorded review
  (see §4: actuator surface).
- **Phase 4 sync trigger (2026-10-09): same boundary, one new mutating
  surface.** `POST /api/v1/twin/sync` writes to the twin, so it gets two
  loopback layers instead of one: the server binds `127.0.0.1` by default
  and the endpoint refuses non-loopback transport peers with 403
  (`getRemoteAddr()` only — `X-Forwarded-For` is untrusted input and is
  ignored; a missing peer is denied). The scanner only reads tracked
  example configs, route annotations, and migration SQL — never live
  `application.properties`, never environment values, never writes to the
  repository, never executes scanned files — so secrets cannot enter twin
  metadata through this path. Connector-owned rows are namespaced by
  `managedBy` marker + `target-*` refs; a squatted identity aborts the
  run (409, rolled back) rather than hijacking the row. Full API
  authentication remains deferred and still gates any non-local exposure.
- **Sampling 1.0 is local-only.** Full trace sampling is proportional to
  development traffic. Any shared or higher-traffic environment needs a
  sampling decision first.

## 3. Out-of-scope today, in-scope for design

- Authentication/authorization mechanism (the twin API and all four target
  service APIs are currently open — acceptable on a local machine, not
  beyond it), secret management, key rotation. Each service's database
  credential is a separate local secret; compromising one application user
  yields that service's database only.
- Twin-connector authentication and data-integrity guarantees.
- Approval UX and delegation model; risk-classification taxonomy.
- Execution sandboxing, blast-radius limits, rollback/verification loops.
- Persistence hardening and audit-log immutability (tables exist now;
  hardening still to come).

Each must reference the principle(s) above when introduced; any exception
requires a dated entry in `DECISIONS.md`.

## 4. What must NOT happen next (anti-goals)

- Direct agent-to-target execution paths bypassing the control plane.
- LLM output concatenated into queries, shell, or config without mediation.
- Silent policy bypasses, self-approval, or unaudited "break-glass" writes.
- Broadening the Actuator or API surface without a recorded security review.
- Hibernate schema auto-generation (`update`/`create`/`create-drop`) against any
  database that matters; committed credentials in any form.
- Direct cross-service database access (even read-only) bypassing the HTTP
  boundary; shared schemas or cross-database foreign keys between services.
