# Systivex Architectural Decisions

Record of binding decisions taken at project foundation (2026-09-28) and
extended in Phase 1 and Phase 2A (2026-09-29), Phase 2B and Phase 3A (2026-09-30).
Status labels: **decided** (binding now) / **planned** (intent, not yet implemented).

## D1. Java 21 — decided

- **Decision:** Java 21 as the language baseline (`<java.version>21</java.version>`, `release 21`).
- **Rationale:** LTS, virtual threads, modern language features; matches Spring Boot 4.x requirements.
- **State:** Implemented and verified (`./mvnw test` compiles with `release 21` on JDK 21.0.10).

## D2. Spring Boot (4.1.1) — decided

- **Decision:** Spring Boot 4.1.1 via `spring-boot-starter-parent` for the control plane.
- **Rationale:** Convention-based wiring, production-ready Actuator surface, mature test support.
- **State:** Implemented and verified (banner `v4.1.1`, Tomcat 11.0.24).

## D3. Maven (Wrapper) — decided

- **Decision:** Maven with the checked-in Wrapper (3.9.16, `wrapperVersion 3.3.4`); no Gradle.
- **Rationale:** Reproducible builds without a preinstalled Maven; standard Spring layout.
- **State:** Implemented and verified (`./mvnw test | package | spring-boot:run`).

## D4. Modular monolith for the Systivex control plane — decided

- **Decision:** Systivex itself is a **modular monolith**: one Spring Boot deployment
  with strict internal module boundaries (`twin`, `intelligence`, `policy`,
  `execution`, `verification`, `observation`, `api` as target modules).
- **Rationale:** Single deployable is operable at this scale; explicit module APIs
  preserve the option to extract services later without paying distribution costs now.
- **State:** Planned structure; **no module packages exist yet** (no placeholders by decision).

## D5. Microservices reserved for the target environment — decided

- **Decision:** Microservices are the shape of the **future target software environment**
  (systems under observation/management), never of the Systivex control plane at this stage.
- **Rationale:** Keeps a hard control-plane vs. target-environment separation;
  avoids distributed-systems overhead before there is anything to manage.
- **State:** Deferred; no target services exist.

## D6. PostgreSQL as primary persistence — decided (activated 2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** PostgreSQL is the primary system of record (twin state first;
  proposals, policy decisions, execution/verification records later).
- **Rationale:** Relational integrity and auditability suit safety-critical records.
- **State:** Implemented in Phase 1: local PostgreSQL 18, `systivex` database,
  `systivex_app` owner. Previously deferred; activated when the twin model
  needed persistence, per the original intent.

## D7. Redis only when justified — decided

- **Decision:** No Redis until a concrete, measured need (e.g. rate limiting, ephemeral
  coordination, cache with invalidation story) is recorded.
- **Rationale:** Avoids a second state system and its consistency/ops burden prematurely.
- **State:** Deferred; no Redis dependency or configuration exists.

## D8. Spring AI + Ollama later — planned

- **Decision:** Agent reasoning will use Spring AI against local Ollama models first
  (cloud models only if a later decision permits).
- **Rationale:** Keeps inference local and cost-predictable during development;
  Spring AI gives provider portability behind the control-plane boundary.
- **State:** Deferred; no Spring AI dependency, no model configuration exists.

## D9. REST + SSE initially — decided

- **Decision:** Synchronous surface is REST; streaming progress (analysis/simulation)
  is Server-Sent Events. No WebSockets at this stage.
- **Rationale:** REST covers CRUD/authorization flows; SSE covers one-way progress
  without the lifecycle/state costs of bidirectional sockets.
- **State:** Partially implemented; twin entity/relationship CRUD exists under
  `/api/v1/twin`. Proposals/approvals/records and SSE are still planned.

## D10. No premature infrastructure — decided

- **Decision:** Do not introduce Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, WebSockets, vector
  databases, MCP, multi-agent architecture, or cloud infrastructure at this stage.
  Likewise no Docker Compose, security architecture, or frontend scaffolding yet.
- **Rationale:** Each adds ops surface, failure modes, and security scope without a
  consumer. Infrastructure follows demonstrated need and a recorded decision.
- **State:** Enforced in this phase; no Kafka/RabbitMQ/K8s/WebSockets/vector DB/
  MCP/multi-agent/cloud. `pom.xml` holds only the Phase 1 persistence and web
  set (see `DEVELOPMENT.md` §2 for the list).

## D11. Flyway owns the schema; Hibernate only validates — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** All schema change goes through versioned Flyway migrations under
  `db/migration/`; `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` everywhere, including
  local runs. `update`/`create`/`create-drop` are banned outside throwaway
  scratch work that never touches a shared database.
- **Rationale:** The migration history is the reviewable, replayable record of
  what the schema is; validation keeps the JPA mapping honest without giving
  the ORM write access to the schema.
- **State:** Implemented: `V1__create_system_twin.sql`, validated at every
  startup and in tests.

## D12. Twin persistence model v1 — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** Two tables (`system_entity`, `system_relationship`), UUID keys,
  closed enum type sets (7 entity, 8 relationship), JSONB metadata through
  Hibernate's native JSON mapping (no extra JSON library), FK constraints with
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`, unique `external_ref` and `(source, target, type)`
  triples, no-self-reference check.
- **Rationale:** Covers what Phase 1 needs to prove (persist, link, constrain)
  with the fewest moving parts; enums stay closed until a connector demands more.
- **State:** Implemented with repository, service, DTO REST layer, and
  constraint tests.

## D13. Testcontainers for database tests, one container per run — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** Integration tests run against throwaway PostgreSQL 18 containers
  (single shared container per JVM via `@DynamicPropertySource`); the
  developer's local database is never used by tests. Testcontainers stays a
  test-scope-only dependency.
- **Rationale:** CI-reproducible without local setup; one container avoids the
  churn of per-class containers. Local runs still target the developer's own
  PostgreSQL with `SYSTIVEX_DB_PASSWORD` from the environment.
- **State:** Implemented: 21 of 29 tests run against the container.

## D14. Boot 4 dependency notes — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** Use `spring-boot-starter-flyway` (raw `flyway-core` alone gets no
  auto-configuration in Boot 4); Testcontainers modules by their 2.x names
  (`testcontainers-postgresql`, version via an imported `testcontainers-bom`
  pinned to the release Boot 4.1.1 manages); `spring-boot-starter-restclient-test`
  for `TestRestTemplate` in API tests.
- **Rationale:** Boot 4 split several starters/modules; following the new
  coordinates keeps versions managed instead of hand-pinned.
- **State:** Implemented in `pom.xml` (see the BOM comment there).

## D15. Target microservices live apart from the control plane — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** The observed system (`backend/target-services/`: gateway, order,
  payment, inventory) is built as separate Spring Boot deployables, while
  Systivex itself stays a modular monolith. The two sides share no code, no
  database, and no packages — only HTTP contracts documented in
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.
- **Rationale:** The control-plane/target-environment split is the whole point
  of the architecture: the decider must not be the thing being changed. Separate
  deployables make the future observation boundary real instead of notional,
  without paying for brokers, service mesh, or orchestration before anything
  needs them.
- **State:** Implemented: 4 services, fixed dev ports 8081–8084, verified
  end to end. Control-plane code untouched.

## D16. Plain RestClient edge, deterministic stateless targets — decided (2026-09-29)

- **Decision:** Service-to-service calls use plain `RestClient` with
  configuration-driven URLs; the "gateway" is an explicit forwarding controller,
  not a gateway framework. Inventory/payment answer from fixed demo rules
  (reject > 5 units, decline > 5000.00) with no database; failures surface as
  422/503/502 with sanitized bodies and basic timeouts, no retry or
  circuit-breaker libraries.
- **Rationale:** A framework gateway and resilience machinery would hide the
  very HTTP behavior Phase 2A exists to demonstrate. Deterministic rules make
  tests and demos repeatable; persistence arrives per-service in Phase 2B.
- **State:** Superseded in Phase 2B for the persistence part (D17): the demo
  quantity rule is replaced by real stock, but the payment amount rule stays
  and the RestClient/no-retry/no-gateway-framework shape is unchanged.

## D17. Service-owned databases, no cross-service data access — decided (2026-09-30)

- **Decision:** Each target service owns exactly one PostgreSQL database
  (`order_db`/`order_app`, `payment_db`/`payment_app`,
  `inventory_db`/`inventory_app`), migrated by that service's own Flyway
  history and validated by its own JPA mappings (`ddl-auto=validate`). The
  control-plane database (`systivex`/`systivex_app`) is untouched and shares
  nothing with them. No service reads or writes another service's tables, no
  shared schemas, no cross-database foreign keys — not even for "read-only"
  convenience. If order-service needs payment or inventory facts, it calls
  those services over HTTP and treats the response as untrusted input
  (validated DTOs, same as before).
- **Rationale:** A shared database would quietly recouple services that HTTP
  boundaries keep apart: one team's migration could break another service,
  and "just this one join" becomes distributed logic with no contract. The
  database boundary makes the service boundary real — each schema can evolve
  with its owner, and every cross-service read stays visible as an HTTP call
  with explicit failure modes. Separate application users (each owning only
  its database) enforce this at the PostgreSQL level, not just by convention.
- **State:** Implemented: `orders` in order_db; `payments` in payment_db;
  `inventory_items` + `inventory_reservations` in inventory_db (no FK between
  the two, so rejected attempts for unknown products are still recordable).
  Known limitation accepted, not solved: checkout is not atomic across the
  three databases — a FAILED order can coexist with a standing reservation.
  Faking atomicity (cross-DB writes, a transaction coordinator) was rejected;
  the honest PENDING → CONFIRMED/FAILED record is the foundation a future
  reconciliation/simulation story can build on.

## D18. Telemetry before twin ingestion — decided (2026-09-30)

- **Decision:** Instrument the target environment for metrics/traces/logs
  (Phase 3A) before building any System Twin runtime ingestion of that
  telemetry.
- **Rationale:** Ingestion built against uninstrumented services would define
  its data contracts against guesses. Real, running telemetry — with known
  span names, metric names, and correlation behavior verified end to end —
  gives the future ingestion work an observed contract to consume instead of
  a speculative one. The control plane still consumes nothing; the two sides
  of the pipeline are built and verified independently.
- **State:** Implemented: the four target services plus the control plane emit
  OTLP traces and Prometheus metrics; collection is verified locally. No twin
  ingestion exists.

## D19. Minimal Boot-managed observability, pull-based metrics — decided (2026-09-30)

- **Decision:** Two dependencies per service, both version-managed by the
  Boot 4.1.1 BOM: `spring-boot-starter-opentelemetry` (tracing + W3C context
  propagation) and `micrometer-registry-prometheus` (scrape endpoint). No
  hand-pinned OTel/Micrometer versions, no second instrumentation library.
  Metrics stay pull-based (`/actuator/prometheus`); OTLP metric export and
  OTLP log export are disabled. Logs stay on the console with a trace/span
  correlation pattern. Sampling is 1.0 — acceptable only because all traffic
  is local development volume.
- **Rationale:** Managed versions remove a whole class of span-duplication and
  version-skew faults. Pull-based metrics need no per-service export
  configuration and fail visibly (empty scrape) rather than silently (dropped
  push). A single local OpenTelemetry Collector (contrib, pinned image) is
  the only infrastructure: OTLP receiver for traces, Prometheus receiver
  re-scraping the services, debug exporter to its own log for trace
  verification, Prometheus exporter on :8889. No dashboards, log store, or
  trace store — visualization is Phase 3B.
- **State:** Implemented. Three custom business spans only (`checkout`,
  `inventory.reservation`, `payment.authorization`); everything else is
  automatic HTTP instrumentation. Six tag-free business counters
  (`checkout.success/failure`, `inventory.reservation.success/rejected`,
  `payment.authorization.success/declined`) — outcome in the name, no
  customer/order/product/trace labels. RestClient builders carry the
  observation registry explicitly so trace context crosses each HTTP hop.
- **Telemetry-error redaction (closure fix, 2026-09-30):** automatic
  client-error spans copied downstream 4xx response bodies into
  `exception.message`, and custom business observations recorded
  service-layer messages — both can carry customer/product/amount data.
  Verified root cause: the OTel bridge calls `Span.recordException`
  immediately in the tracing handler's `onError`, so a stop-time
  `ObservationFilter` would run too late. Fix: one stateless
  `ObservationErrorSanitizer` (`ObservationHandler<Observation.Context>`,
  `@Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)`, picked up by Boot's ordered handler
  registration) per deployable replaces the recorded error with a
  payload-free equivalent carrying only the original exception type name
  and, for `HttpStatusCodeException`, the HTTP status. No cause chain (a
  cause would reintroduce the payload via the stacktrace attribute).
  Thrown exceptions, API responses, and logs are untouched. Side effect,
  accepted: timer `error` tags report the sanitizer type on error
  observations instead of the original type (still low-cardinality).
   Regression test `TelemetryPrivacyTest` (order-service) fails without the
   sanitizer and passes with it — verified both directions.
- **Telemetry-error redaction, correction (2026-10-06):** the 2026-09-30
  `@Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)` fix was insufficient and live verification
  proved it: Boot 4.1.1 registers tracing/meter handlers through its
  `TracingAndMeterObservationHandlerGroup` composite AHEAD of ungrouped
  `ObservationHandler` beans, so the tracing handler's `onError` recorded
  the raw exception (`Span.recordException` → `exception.message` /
  `exception.stacktrace` / status description) BEFORE the late sanitizer
  replaced the final recorded error. Verified against the actual jars
  (Boot 4.1.1 `ObservationHandlerGroups.register` sorts groups and registers
  group composites before ungrouped handlers; Micrometer 1.17.1
  `SimpleObservation.notifyOnError` notifies handlers sequentially in
  registration order; Micrometer-tracing 1.7.1 `TracingObservationHandler`
  records `context.getError()` at notification time). Fix, per deployable:
  the sanitizer now belongs to its own `SanitizerObservationHandlerGroup`
  ordered before the tracing group, so its `onError` replaces the error
  first and the tracing handler records only the sanitized replacement.
  Joining the tracing group itself was rejected: group members dispatch
  first-match, which would suppress the real tracing handler. Preserved:
  HTTP status, original exception type name, observation/span names, trace
  context. Removed: response bodies, business messages, cause chain.
  `TelemetryPrivacyTest` now asserts on in-memory RECORDED SPAN DATA
  (event attributes + status description), and
  `TelemetryPrivacyUnsanitizedTest` proves the same payload leaks with the
  sanitizer removed — verified failing-without / passing-with on 2026-10-06,
  plus a live collector-log check with zero synthetic-token hits.

## D20. Prometheus + Grafana visualization on the existing metrics path — decided (2026-10-06)

- **Decision:** Extend the existing `observability/docker-compose.yml`
  (no second Compose file) with pinned `prom/prometheus:v3.5.0` (:9090)
  and `grafana/grafana:12.1.0` (:3000). Prometheus scrapes ONLY the OTel
  Collector's `:8889` exposition — the collector stays the sole scraper
  of the Java services, so no duplicate collection path exists. Grafana
  gets its Prometheus datasource and the single `Systivex Metrics`
  dashboard purely through file provisioning (`observability/grafana/`);
  local Grafana defaults, no secrets in the repo, no database files in Git.
  Per-service identity uses a `server_port` → `service` relabel in
  `prometheus.yml`, because the collector stamps `service_name="systivex"`
  on every scraped app metric. OTel histograms arrive without buckets on
  this path, so the latency panel is a sum/count average, not a p95 —
  recorded here so nobody "fixes" it back to a quantile that returns no
  data. No Java application changes; no Loki/Tempo, no twin ingestion, no
  agent use (all still deferred).
- **Rationale:** Visualization must consume the observed contract, not
  redefine it: one more scrape hop would double-load the services and
  split the metric identity scheme. Provisioning (not browser clicks)
  keeps the dashboard reproducible from a fresh checkout.
- **State:** Implemented and verified live 2026-10-06 (checkout + failure
  scenarios move the dashboard metrics; control plane verified on a
  temporary :8090 because :8080 is held by another project on this
  machine).

## Supersession rule

New decisions amend this file with date and rationale; they never silently edit
history. If reality diverges from any entry, `PROJECT_STATUS.md` records the
discrepancy first.
